%% membership_test.m is a function that tests whether a point lies on an 
%% ellipse, the co-gradient locus of two ellipses and checks in general the
%% point's membership in sets of interest.
%
% Given a point 'x' and the parameter sets E_i and E_j for two ellipses, 
% this function computes the distance of the point from the first ellipse 
% and checks its relationship to the second ellipse’s co-gradient locus. 
% It also checks a condition related to the inner product of the ellipses' 
% vectors.
%
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Inputs:
%   x    - Point to test [x, y]
%   E_i  - Parameter set of the first ellipse [a, b, theta, o_x, o_y]
%   E_j  - Parameter set of the second ellipse [a, b, theta, o_x, o_y]
%
% Outputs:
%   ellipse  - Scalar value representing the distance of the point `x` from 
%              the first ellipse (based on the quadratic form), must equal
%              1 (or 1.0000).
%   locus    - Vector representing the cross product of the vectors from 
%              the point 'x' to the centers of the ellipses, indicating 
%              whether the point is on the co-gradient locus, must equal
%              [0; 0; 0]
%   bon_point - Boolean value indicating whether the dot product of the 
%               vectors from 'x' to the ellipses' centers is negative, 
%               suggesting a certain geometrical relationship, must be 1

function [ellipse, locus, bon_point] = membership_test(x, E_i, E_j)

    % Compute the quadratic matrices and centers of the ellipses
    [Q_i, o_i] = Matrices(E_i);
    [Q_j, o_j] = Matrices(E_j);
    
    % Compute the distance of the point from the first ellipse (equation)
    ellipse = (x - o_i)'*Q_i*(x - o_i);
    
    % Compute the cross product of the vectors from point to centers
    locus = cross([Q_i*(x - o_i); 0], [Q_j*(x - o_j); 0]);
    
    % Check if the dot product of the vectors from the point to the ellipse
    % centers is negative
    bon_point = dot(Q_i*(x - o_i), Q_j*(x - o_j)) < 0;
